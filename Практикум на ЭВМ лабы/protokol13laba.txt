Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video
game developed and published by Valve Corporation. The game 
is a sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA), which was a 
community-created mod for Blizzard Entertainment Warcraft III: Reign 
of Chaos and its expansion pack, The Frozen Throne. Dota 2
is played in matches between two teams of five players, 
with each team occupying and defending their own separate 
base on the map. Each of the ten players independently
controls a powerful character, known as a "hero", who all
have unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a 
match, players collect experience points and items for their 
heroes to successfully defeat the opposing team heroes in
player versus player combat. A team wins by being the first 
to destroy a large structure located in the opposing team 
base, called the "Ancient".

Development of Dota 2 began in 2009 when IceFrog, lead designer
of the original Defense of the Ancients mod, was hired by Valve
to create a modernized remake in the Source game engine. It was 
officially released for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux-based 
personal computers via the digital distribution platform Steam in 
July 2013, following a Windows-only public beta phase that began 
two years prior. As the game is fully free-to-play with no heroes 
needing to be bought or unlocked, revenue is made from microtransactions,
specifically loot boxes, battle passes, and a monthly-based subscription
system called Dota Plus, which all offer non-gameplay altering virtual 
goods, such as cosmetic hero armor and weapon replacements, in return. 
The game has also been updated with various other features since release,
such as support for virtual reality (VR) and a full transition to the
Source 2 engine in 2015.

Queen are a British rock band that formed in London in 1970. Their classic line-up was Freddie Mercury
(lead vocals and piano), Brian May (lead guitar and vocals), Roger Taylor (drums and vocals), 
and John Deacon (bass guitar). Their earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, 
hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly 
works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock, into their music.

Before forming Queen, May and Taylor had played together in the band Smile. 
Mercury, then known by his birth name, Farrokh Bulsara, was a fan of Smile and encouraged them 
to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques. 
Mercury joined in 1970, suggested the name "Queen", and adopted his familiar stage name. 
Deacon was recruited before the band recorded their eponymous debut album in 1973. 
Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, Queen II, in 1974, 
but it was the release of Sheer Heart Attack later that year and A Night at the Opera 
in 1975 which brought them international success. The latter featured "Bohemian Rhapsody",
which stayed at number one in the UK for nine weeks and also helped to popularise the music video.
